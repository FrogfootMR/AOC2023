# AOC2023

## Info

My repository for the Advent of Code 2023! ðŸŽ„ This repository will contain my solutions to the programming challenges presented in Advent of Code, an annual coding event that takes place leading up to Christmas. I've attempted to solve each challenge so feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or compare solutions.

## Repository Structure

- Each day's challenge is organized into its own directory (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`).
- Inside each directory, you will find the problem statement, my solution code (in Python, Scheme, or JavaScript), and any additional resources.
